    - quotation: Bass Michael Uloth brought a rich, melifluous tone and a striking figure to the stage. His singing is rich and low without feeling woofy or manufactured.
      source: Greg Finney, Schmopera
      link: https://www.schmopera.com/equal-parts-stressful-and-reverent-atgbound/
    - quotation: It requires no small amount of courage on the part of a bass to sing a piece originally written for castrato. To his abiding credit, Uloth enthusastically embraces the challenge, tackling [the] deservedly-celebrated "Ombra mai fu"...with a fine sense of proportion.
      source: Ian Ritchie, Opera Going Toronto
      link: http://operagoto.com/bound-review/
    - quotation: Uloth conveys his despair through the well-known “Ombra mai fu” from Serse...he gave a tender interpretation of this challenging aria.
